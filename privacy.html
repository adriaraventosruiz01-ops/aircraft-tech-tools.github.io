    <p>
      MEL Date Calc (“the app”) is provided by Aircraft Tech Tools.
      This policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Data you enter in the app</h2>
  <p>
    The app may store information you input, such as aircraft tail, defect text, WO/TL page,
    and optional technical log photos. This data is stored locally on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Advertising (Free version)</h2>
  <p>
    The free version may show ads using Google Mobile Ads (AdMob).
    Ad providers may collect device identifiers and usage data to serve ads and measure performance,
    in accordance with their policies.
  </p>

  <h2>In-App Purchases (Pro)</h2>
  <p>
    Pro unlock is handled by Apple/Google billing. Purchase verification is performed through the store APIs.
    We do not collect or store your payment details.
  </p>

  <h2>Reports and sharing</h2>
  <p>
    If you generate and share a PDF report, the content shared is the content you created in the app
    (including any photos you attached). Sharing is initiated by you using the system share sheet.
  </p>

  <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Data is stored locally on your device. You can delete log entries inside the app.
    Removing the app from your device typically removes locally stored data.
